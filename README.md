## What is NLP?

NLP stands for Natural Language Processing. NLP is the ability of a computer program to understand human language as it is spoken and written.

## Basic Terms in NLP

1. The smallest unit of NLP data is a **character**.

```
character = 'g'
```

2. A sequence of characters that make up a "word" is called a **token**.

```
token = "good"
```

3. A sequence of tokens that convey a meaning on its own is called a **document**.

```
document = "A. R. Rahman is a good film composer and songwriter."
```

4. A collection of documents is called a **corpus**.

```
corpus = [
	"A. R. Rahman is a good film composer and songwriter.",
	"Pineapple on pizzas is a very bad idea.",
	"I like anime. Steins;Gate is my favourite",
	"My introvert friend is terrible at communicating.",
]
```

## Basic Preprocessing involved in NLP

1. **Tokenization**: breaks down text into smaller semantic units or single clauses
2. **Part-of-speech-tagging**: marking up words as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, etc
3. **Stemming and lemmatization**: standardizing words by reducing them to their root forms
4. **Stop word removal**: filtering out common words that add little or no unique information, for example, prepositions and articles (at, to, a, the).
